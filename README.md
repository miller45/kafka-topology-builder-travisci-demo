# kafka-topology-builder-travisci-demo

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nerdynick/kafka-topology-builder-travisci-demo.svg?branch=master)

A variation of the [Kafka Topology Builder Jenkins Demo](https://github.com/purbon/kafka-topology-builder-demo), but leveraging [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/github/nerdynick/kafka-topology-builder-travisci-demo) instead of Jenkins.

**NOTE:** This demo is a brief and simple showcase of the [Kafka Topology Builder](https://github.com/purbon/kafka-topology-builder) for strictly demo purposes only. 

This showcases both Master branch merges and Pull Request verification checks.
